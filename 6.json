Finally, if a cluster seems to have been repeated, give it a tag 'x similar to y' and provide the cluster numbers for x and y respectively.\n\nCLUSTERS TO CLASSIFY:\n\n0\nThe rucksack straps are not as good as straps on a real rucksack, but are better than straps on a regular bag.\nRucksack straps can't be compared to the straps on a real rucksack, but are more reminiscent of straps that come with bags.\n1\nAdditional shortcoming is lack of inner compartments.\nNot enough additional small compartments.\nThe lack of compartments in the pack is a problem.\nNot enough compartments for small items.\n2\nProduct is very beautiful, but extremely heavy.\nProduct heavier than advertised.\nProduct is heavy for its size.\nProduct is heavy when empty.\n3\nProduct unsuitable for big-shouldered, round-waisted people.\nProduct too small, unsuitable for anybody over 6 feet.\nProduct does not fit bigger people.\nProduct is too small for a tall person.\n4\nShoulder straps are too narrow, cutting into user's shoulders.\nShoulder straps felt too far apart on the shoulders, were trying to ride deep into the armpits, and were forming a creese along the long axis.\nShoulder straps poorly designed, very narrow, no padding.\nShoulder straps are too hard, uncomfortable.\n5\nCustomer was stopped before boarding and pulled out of line, twice, because the backpack appeared too long, and it is.\nBag doesn't fit in overhead bins, but that doesn't matter because if they're going to charge you, it's at the gate.\nUser was charged a 60 euro fine by Easyjet for not fitting in their box, and is worried about being challenged again when getting on a flight.\nCustomer is afraid they won't be able to get on the plane with the backpack.\n6\nSummer bag is too much.\nBag shouldn't be overloaded.\nBag's capacity is too high for daily use, better if shorter.\nBag is over the 22\" limit, and user doesn't want to be in constant fear when traveling.\n7\nNot ideal for backpacking, since bag doesn't have good compression for top section, which dangles.\nBag is a day pack, not suitable for a weekend away unless you are a real minimalist.\nBag is only efficient for shorter day hikes, because compartments are limited.\nBag isn't great in any one category, and user will be looking for a more trekking-focused pack, and a more hiking-focused day pack.\n8\nPrefers other backpacks as daypacks, because they're water-resistant.\nPrefers other backpacks as daypacks because they're water-resistant.\n9\nPrefers Osprey's wider shoulder straps and ability to carry more weight without straps curling and creaking under 35 lbs.\nBag uncomfortable, heavy, with reinforced shoulder straps.\nThe straps are padded and help distribute weight well, making walking around with the bag for 20+ minutes not so terrible.\nWider shoulder straps and ability to carry more weight without straps curling and creaking preferred.\n10\nThe \"shadow gray\" pack is actually a dark green, not gray.\nThe \"shadow grey\" color is actually olive, not grey.\nThe grey color of the pack is not at all like the picture, being a dark olive\/military green.\nColor is olive green, not gray as advertised.\n11\nOsprey doesn't care about well-known complaints about squeaking frame and hard-to-open hip belt pockets.\nOsprey doesn't care about well-known complaints about the squeaking frame and hard-to-open hip belt zipper pockets.\n12\nWarranty only does coat the frame to get the squeak out, should have been done in the first place.\nCreak comes from the frame on the backrest, and is unnerving.\nThe ventilated frame on the pack rubs against it, causing a terrible squeaky sound with every step.\n13\nBackpack color washes out quickly, making it look old after only two months.\nBag color fades after two months of use.\nBlack faded in sun, only used in changing classes.\nBackpack color fading.\n14\nThreads sticking out.\nThread is twisted like a foreign wire and cable.\n15\nMagnet holding mouthpiece could be stronger, sometimes just hangs down in front of user.\nMagnet holding mouthpiece could be stronger.\n16\nSuper backpack is high quality, but too small for user's purposes.\nBag is pretty, but only because it's a backpack type, and it's all loose and doesn't have much capacity.\nKitty Hawk's backpack feels like it can't fit much.\nBackpack is big and made of great quality, but hard to find things because it's big and stiff, with no pockets.\n17\nAfter one month, sewing and logo started to come off.\nSeams dissolved in first month, creating hole in fabric.\nSeam detached on top of wearer, whole carrier fell off after a week.\nSeam came loose, but was quickly repaired.\n18\nOverall workmanship is good, but the details of Vietnamese products are relatively poor.\nWorkmanship is poor, customer wants to return the product.\nWorkmanship and packaging are rough, and price is expensive.\nThe workmanship is not very good.\n19\nRefund promised but not received.\nCustomer service didn't agree to refund difference in price.\nCustomer service unhelpful, refund denied.\nPrevious refund hasn't arrived, customer is too lazy to refund again.\n20\nOld version's soft back panel stuck to user's back, making it sweaty.\nBack part of the sticker will be soaked in sweat when exercising.\nProduct isn't comfortable on hot days, back sweats and water feels heavy.\nUser had a sore lower back and very sweaty summer due to carrying too much stuff on rides.\n21\nDoubts whether a brand introduced by a friend was genuine or not, since it scratched two of user's clothes on back.\nNot sure if item is original, quality not as expected.\nGoods received were very different than advertised, unsure if genuine.\nCustomer doubts that the product was genuine.\n22\nCustomer unhappy that the product he bought is smaller than other products in the series, and that it doesn't have a keyhole for checking in.\nDisappointed that the product wasn't as tall as imagined, and the color was too monotonous.\nCustomer thought the size was smaller than what they thought it was.\nDissapointed that the product wasn't bigger, quality not good enough to last.\n23\nOne strap on the book bag is broken, and the right buckle will buckle at first but then comes loose every couple minutes.\nOne of the straps on the book bag is broken, and the buckle won't stay latched.\nProduct came unstitched from one of the springs that hold the straps of the backpack.\nTop right shoulder strap came off with only volleyball uniform and knee pads in the bag.\n24\nEven when not catching, the \"feel\" of zipping is strained and not fluid.\nZipper doesn't glide smoothly.\nThe zipper is slippery.\nThe constant zipping and unzipping, and snapping, was a hassle for the traveler, but not for his companion.\n25\nWants a side pocket for tent poles.\nThe front pockets are somewhat smaller than on the Xenith 88L, limiting room for tent poles, nalgene bottles, chair kit.\nTwo pockets on the sides for drinking bottles or tent poles, and a pocket on each side of the hip belt.\n26\nColor comes out much brighter than shown, logo applied poorly.\nColor is not as vibrant as the picture, and wasn't liked that the emblem was printed, not raised.\nPixel is too big. Changed to Hermit, feels light on back, but actual color doesn't look as bright as picture. Should have chosen blue.\n27\nBag is heavy, and belts aren't suitable for small girls.\nBag is uncomfortable for male user, who is tall and slender, because it curves in at the bottom and sticks out, digging into his back.\nBag is too large, with rigid back support, and requirements for height of user.\nBag is too heavy for user's smaller female friend, who won't use it again.\n28\nExpected XL backpack to be larger than standard size.\nDescription of product as 'XL' is confusing; product is a normal size backpack.\nSize description should have been better, e.g. which backpacks it fits.\nExtra-large size is misleading, same as standard size for other backpacks.\n29\nBag is a little small, hard to fit all school stuff in.\nSchoolbag isn't suitable for use as a schoolbag.\nBag is too small, more like a daypack than a schoolbag.\nBag is genuine, but too small for a child to use as a schoolbag.\n30\nThe new 2021 version is terrible, because the main compartment is overtaken by the liquids pouch on top of the bag, leaving you with a larger outer pocket and less volume in the main area.\nThe buckle on the backpack isn't as thick as the one on the Kitty Eagle 38l bought a few years ago.\nThe seat cushion isn't covered with fabric like their older backpack.\nThe quality of the backpack feels lower than the previous one.\n31\nUser finds that most baby carriers and hiking backpacks don't fit well, because the lap belt doesn't stay on the hips, but creeps up to the waist, with the result that the shoulder straps lift off the shoulders.\nThinks the hip belt is too narrow\/thin for heavier packs.\nWants a carrier where the distance between the shoulder straps and the \"hip belt\" can be shortened enough so that she can wear the hip belt around her waist and still have the shoulder straps lying against her shoulders.\nDoesn't like that the hip belt and shoulder straps aren't well suited for heavy loads.\n32\nBackpack is cute, but doesn't have a water bottle pocket on the side, and the zipper gets stuck more than the user's other child's Jansport backpack.\nNot holding up like a normal Jansport backpack.\nBag doesn't feel like a Jansport, despite being one.\nJansport backpack's zippers get stuck, fabric is thin and not protective.\n33\nQuality of color is poor, after one year of use.\nThe quality is worrying, and the product dropped after using it twice.\nProduct is of poor quality, handle on backup started shredding after just a couple of uses.\nDoesn't look good after only two months of use.\n34\nUser disappointed that the improvements to the backpack are so minor, they're barely noticeable.\nDissatisfied with the number of closed pockets in Herschel backpacks.\nNot happy with backpack.\nNot happy with backpack.\n35\nBackpacking bag is too expensive.\nBackpack is overpriced, extremely small, and looks trashy after one washing.\nBackpack is too small for the price.\nBackpack is too small and overpriced.\n36\nWants a larger or stretchier side pocket for water.\nWants the front small pocket to be larger.\nWants a bigger side pocket or two on the women's version of the Renn 65, to hold a purse and other items.\nWants more pockets.\n37\nNot comfortable for shorter people, rests low on back.\nBag uncomfortable, unsuitable for female profile.\nOver 15 lbs, it's not comfortable, straps cut into shoulders.\nThe narrow back support system makes it uncomfortable for people with broad shoulders.\n38\nOutdoor bag always tangles in color.\nBag pilled and discolored after first wear.\nDissatisfied with color quality, white stripes forming on backpack after three times carrying without washing.\nThe bag is discolored, and the workmanship is flawed.\n39\nOnly two small interior pockets.\nSmall in size, only one small inside pocket.\nOnly one inside pocket on a lightweight jacket is too small.\nOnly two inside pockets, one for a bottle of water and another for a computer.\n40\nBag is too small for a camping trip.\nBag is too small, after a day of travel.\nBag is too small to go out for the night.\nBag is too big for backpacking trip through Europe.\n41\nFairview backpack is harder to maneuver than Osprey, with not as sturdy materials, and not as easy to connect\/disconnect while wearing.\nWife's Osprey Fairview 70 was more uncomfortable than husband's Farpoint 55, despite being a women's fit.\nUser found the Farpoint 55L has poor security, is unstable, and has poor visibility over one's shoulder.\nExpected smaller, lighter, more spacious bag than Osprey Fairview 55 Women's Travel Backpack.\n42\nThe straps have an old stock texture, and will disfigure if used soon.\nShoulder straps drag on the ground when using wheels, making them useless.\nRegular version has rubber and leather straps that will curl and chip if washed and dried, and mesh on back that will deteriorate from friction and damage cotton t-shirts.\nStraps rip off first day, get caught up in wheels.\n43\nWas a bit nervous about the tight squeeze on the side mesh pocket for water bottle, but kept hydroflask in the main compartment.\nSolid bag, but top pockets hard to tell apart.\nZipper pouch could be a little bigger, but works.\nToo many pocket zippers, but very snug and no sloshing.\n44\nQuality seems as good as their bags.\nQuality of the brand bag should be like this one, but packaging is too low-grade, and it's a few hundred dollars anyway.\nFeels like they could have bought a cheap Walmart bag and gotten the same manufacturing outcome.\nDidn't even take it out of the plastic packaging, but the bag looked cheap, like a copy.\n45\nDort backpack is better for mountaineering, more durable.\nMore ropes than mountaineering bags.\nThinks Fjallraven backpacks are more ergonomic and well-thought-out than the ones they sell.\nThinks the Hans in Happiness hiking backpack is better.\n46\nBlack Kanken laptop 13 with padded straps looks like it's been used for months after just a few hours.\nBackpack looks susceptible to dirt, and user is concerned about sustainability, considering cutting off the many ligaments in the back.\nTwo small problems: The backpack is easily dirtied, and falls off when not full.\nRucking backpack has a nice color, but is torn on the front compartment.\n47\nProduct is not good, too small.\nProduct was too small.\nProduct is too small.\nProduct was too small, returned.\n48\nFew compartments, cards slide out.\nEasily slips out of the side pocket when you take things out of it.\nNet pocket is reasonable, and it is not easy to lose things because of the design.\nNo inside zipper pocket makes it difficult to organize items.\n49\nPocket dislikes the material of the product.\nCustomer dislikes the product, found it uncomfortable, poorly made, and not something a child would want.\nNew product is less good than the picture, worthless, too thin and not friendly to big people.\nProduct isn't very functional.\n50\nFront pocket is somewhat inconvenient to get to.\nFront pocket is a little small.\nThe external pockets on the hips are a little narrow, so the wallet is a tight fit.\nThe front pocket could have been a little bigger.\n51\nCouldn't fit everything if you wanted to bring an umbrella or book.\nStrongly suggests getting a smaller bag for day trips in a city, since while traveling it got tiring trying to take small things out for use in a large city, and if fully packed you end up in the way.\nStorage is cramped, so if you like to carry a lot of stuff it gets tight.\nIt's best to pack odds and ends with storage and put them in the backpack, or things will be messy.\n52\nSide bag for water bottle doesn't seem to be designed well, bottle can easily slip out and fall.\nBag feels weird if you put in a bottle in the mesh pocket, as weight would make bag uneven, bottle would fall off.\nSide bottle pouches are baggy, so if turned over, would fall off.\nBottles can easily slip out of bag and fall.\n53\nReceived black, different from the picture.\nProduct received was different than image or description, of poor quality.\nReceived product different from what was shown in picture and description.\nProduct received was of poor quality, much bulkier and harder than in the shop.\n\n###\n\n</INST><INST> 0 shared\n1 shared\n2 shared\n3
